# Patient Data Management System 
In the realm of healthcare administration, the existing methods of patient data management pose significant challenges. Traditional systems, often reliant on paper-based records and outdated technologies, are marred by inefficiencies, errors, and limited accessibility. The manual nature of these processes results in delays, hindering healthcare professionals' ability to provide timely and accurate care. Security concerns and the evolving complexity of healthcare data further underscore the need for a modern solution. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a robust and scalable patient data management system using the MERN stack.
